# LatexTemplate

This directory contains my LaTeX templates:

- **minimalDoc**: Simple LaTeX document.
- **report**: template with working directory structure for writing report with LaTeX

These templates can be useful to others. Feel free to use it.

I am not a LaTeX expert, but you can still report any issue on GitHub directly ([LatexTemplate/issues](https://github.com/juliendiot42/LatexTemplate/issues)), I'll do my best.
